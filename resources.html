        <h3>Understanding Macronutrients</h3>
        <p>Macronutrients are nutrients required in large amounts in our diet. They include carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Each plays a crucial role in our body's function:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Carbohydrates:</strong> The body's primary source of energy, providing glucose which fuels your brain and muscles during exercise. Complex carbohydrates, such as whole grains and legumes, provide sustained energy and essential nutrients.</li>
            <li><strong>Proteins:</strong> Essential for building and repairing tissues, proteins are made up of amino acids. Some amino acids are essential and must be obtained from food sources. Good sources include lean meats, dairy, beans, and legumes.</li>
            <li><strong>Fats:</strong> Important for hormone production and nutrient absorption, fats can be categorized into saturated, unsaturated, and trans fats. Healthy fats (such as those from avocados, nuts, and olive oil) are vital for optimal body function and overall health.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Understanding how to balance these macronutrients according to your health goals is essential for a well-rounded diet. For instance, an athlete may need more carbohydrates for energy, while someone looking to lose weight may focus on higher protein intake.</p>

        <h3>Healthy Eating Tips for Busy People</h3>
        <p>Eating healthy while managing a busy lifestyle can be challenging. Here are some tips:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Plan meals in advance:</strong> Preparing meals for the week on weekends can help you avoid last-minute unhealthy choices.</li>
            <li><strong>Keep healthy snacks on hand:</strong> Options like nuts, fruits, yogurt, and cut vegetables can help curb hunger and maintain energy levels.</li>
